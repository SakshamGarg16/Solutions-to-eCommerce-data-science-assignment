# eCommerce Data Analysis

This repository contains the solutions to the eCommerce data science assignment, divided into three main tasks:
1. **Task 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
2. **Task 2: Lookalike Model**
3. **Task 3: Customer Segmentation/Clustering**

Each task is organized in its respective folder, containing code, outputs, and relevant documentation. The dataset used for the assignment is included in each task folder for easy reference.
